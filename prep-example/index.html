    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
     I would like to make a web application that gamifies and streamlines
     the mealprep experience. From food ingredient inflow, to consumption outflow,
     I want this app to make it easy to strategize meals and update changes to
     a kitchen state, so that any user within the kitchen can keep track of changes.
